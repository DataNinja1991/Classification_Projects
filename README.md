The data has been split into two groups: training set (train.csv) and test set (test.csv). The training has been used to build the machine learning models. The model is based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. I have also used feature engineering to create new features.

The test set has been used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. For each passenger in the test set, the model will predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
